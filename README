IF YOU WANT TO USE IT JUST DOWNLOAD THE PACKAGE THAT NEED TO INSTALL, AND THAT IS:
1. customtkinter
2. ctypes
3. Pillow
4. pytube
ALL OF THEM ARE RECOMMENDED TO BE THE DOWNLOADED IN NEWEST VERSION

RECOMMENDED PYTHON VERSION TO USE IT IS 3.9+
IN MY MACHINE I USE 3.12

HOW TO USE IT:
1. TAKE URL YOUTUBE VIDEO THAT YOU WANT TO DOWNLOAD, RUN THE SCRIPT (main.py) AND JUST PASTE IT IN URL BOX
2. AND THEN YOU CAN CHOOSE WHERE YOU CAN SAVE IT(IN BOX DOWNLOAD PATH)
3. WAIT FOR THE DOWNLOAD AND THEN DONE 

note:
there's a error with pytube(version 15.0.0 the version that i'm using), i don't really know much about it i'm sorry
but you can see it in the forum discussion right here:
https://github.com/pytube/pytube/issues/1954

but to summerize it you can just change the pattern in cipher file in folder pytube, to be precise it's in line 264
with this:
r'a\.[a-zA-Z]\s*&&\s*\([a-z]\s*=\s*a\.get\("n"\)\)\s*&&.*?\|\|\s*([a-z]+)',
r'\([a-z]\s*=\s*([a-zA-Z0-9$]+)(\[\d+\])?\([a-z]\)',
r'\([a-z]\s*=\s*([a-zA-Z0-9$]+)(\[\d+\])\([a-z]\)',
